## Meaning and Significance

Eid-ul-Adha is celebrated to honor the willingness of **Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.)** to sacrifice his son **Ismail (A.S.)** as an act of obedience to **Allah (SWT)**. But Allah replaced his son with a ram at the last moment. This event teaches Muslims about faith, sacrifice, and trust in God.

Muslims around the world remember this act by **sacrificing animals** such as cows, goats, or sheep. The meat is shared among family, relatives, and the poor.

## Moon Sighting and Date

The date of Eid-ul-Adha is based on the **Islamic lunar calendar**, and it falls on the **10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah**, the last month of the Islamic year. In Bangladesh, the **National Moon Sighting Committee** decides the official date after observing the moon.

In 2025, Eid-ul-Adha is likely to be on **June 8**, but this may vary depending on the sighting of the moon. Official announcements are made by the **Islamic Foundation Bangladesh**.

## Preparations Before Eid

### 1. Buying Qurbani Animals

One of the most exciting parts of Eid-ul-Adha in Bangladesh is buying animals for sacrifice. People go to **haat bazaars** (animal markets) to buy **cows, goats, or buffaloes**. Many large cattle markets open in cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, and Rajshahi weeks before Eid.

In recent years, many people also **buy animals online**, especially from trusted websites offering home delivery and halal-certified animals.

### 2. Cleaning and Decorating

As the festival nears, families clean their homes and decorate them with lights and banners. New clothes are bought for the Eid prayers. Children wait eagerly for the big day.

### 3. Spiritual Preparation

Muslims also prepare spiritually by offering extra prayers, making **duas**, and thinking about the meaning of sacrifice. Many families also donate money or food to the poor before Eid.

## Eid Day Celebrations

### 1. Eid Prayer

On the morning of Eid, Muslims take a bath, wear clean clothes (usually new), and go to the **Eidgahs** or mosques for the special **Eid-ul-Adha prayer**. It is a **congregational prayer** followed by a **sermon (khutbah)**.

Men and boys usually go to large open fields, while some women pray at home.

### 2. Animal Sacrifice (Qurbani)

After the prayer, the **Qurbani** begins. It is a religious duty for those who are financially able. The sacrificed animal must be **healthy and free from defects**.

The meat is divided into three parts:
- One-third for the family.
- One-third for relatives and friends.
- One-third for the poor and needy.

This sharing reflects the values of equality and kindness in Islam.

### 3. Distribution and Cooking

The meat is packed and distributed to neighbors, friends, and the less fortunate. Special dishes are prepared at home. Some popular items in Bangladeshi homes during Eid are:

- **Beef curry**
- **Kacchi biryani**
- **Rezala**
- **Shemai (vermicelli dessert)**
- **Firni and Payesh**

Families invite relatives and neighbors to join them for meals and celebrate together.

## Social Media and Technology

In 2025, technology plays a big role in Eid celebrations. People share **Eid Mubarak greetings** on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Many also live stream their Eid prayers or Qurbani moments. Virtual Qurbani services are becoming more common for those living abroad or in cities.

## Safety, Hygiene, and Awareness

Bangladeshâ€™s city corporations take steps to maintain **cleanliness** during Eid. They set up **designated spots for Qurbani**, and trucks are used to remove waste.

Citizens are advised to follow:

- Proper hygiene while handling meat.
- Avoiding animal sacrifice on roads or near drains.
- Wearing gloves and masks if necessary.

Veterinary doctors also check animals before they are sold in the market to avoid the spread of disease.

## Eid for the Poor and Orphans

Many **charity organizations** arrange Qurbani meat distribution for **orphans, widows, and the poor**. Some people even donate full animals to orphanages or remote villages. These acts of kindness bring smiles to those who cannot afford Qurbani themselves.
